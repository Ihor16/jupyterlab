# Running Jupyter Lab locally
A script for starting a local instance of Jupyter Lab in a Docker container.

### Startup
1. Run `run.sh` to start the Jupyter Lab
2. Put some files to the `materials/` directory. They'll be available in Jupyter, so you can work on them there

### Shutdown
1. Run `uninstall.sh` to stop the local Jupyter Lab.
After you close Jupyter, the files you put in the `materials/` directory are saved there
